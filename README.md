# NFL Playoffs Data Scrape

This second pass through using python to scrape sports data was a lot of fun.

The goal of this project was to link the data I could pull from the internet into deliverable visualizations in tableau.

## Final Product

Check out **"final.ipynb"** to see the entire scrape, and each visualization.

Here's a sneak peek of the final visualizations: <br>

<img src="/sbhangover/nflplayoffresults.png" alt="NFL Playoff Results vs Next Season Playoff Results" style="width:100%;height:100%; padding-top:10px"> NFL Playoff Results vs Next Season Playoff Results <br>

Also, look at **fulldata.csv** for a nice csv of all of the data I collected. There are still so many different visualizations to be made from this ream of playoff data.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!
